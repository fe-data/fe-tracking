Documentation
=============

The *FE Tracking* IOS and Android App project documentation is build using [Sphinx docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/index.html), which uses [reST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) for its markup.  This allows the docs to cover a vast amount of topics without using a huge README file.

Read the Sphinx docs carefully and start writing your documentation in the `docs` directory with your favorite editor. Once done execute:

```bash
$ make html
```

The docs will be generated, and the output files will be placed in the `_build/html/` directory, and can be browsed (locally) with any browser.

*FE Tracking* uses [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) to host multiple versions of the documentation in different formats (PDF, html and ePub).

The docs can be found online at <https://fe-tracking.fast-events.eu/>.
