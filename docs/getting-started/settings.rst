Disable checkpoint circles
  The checkpoints on the track are shown as light grey circles and light green circles when a checkpoint is passed.
  Disabling this option has no effect on the indication of whether a checkpoint has been passed or not.
  If uploading is selected, the date and time of passing the checkpoint is still sent to the event organisation's server.

  The colour of the track on the map. Click on the coloured circle to change its colour.

  The line width (1 - 10) of the track.

General settings
----------------

Audio silence period
  Android only. If the sound output is set to bluetooth, some phones may skip the first part of the spoken text.
  This is because it can take some time for the bluetooth connection to be established. Use this parameter to delay the text by a few milliseconds.
