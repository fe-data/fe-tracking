General settings
----------------

Upload checkpoints
  If this is switched on, the organisation's server will be notified when a checkpoint is passed.
  Checkpoints that have already been passed will not be reported to the organisation. If mobile data and/or WiFi is not available the App will retry as soon there is a data connection.
  Data usage is very minimal; it is less than 1k per checkpoint.

  No privacy-sensitive information is transmitted to the server. The name of the checkpoint, date and time when it was passed, the qrcode of the eticket and two signatures that are unique for the route and checkpoint for this eticket.

Sound
  A short sound is played as soon as a checkpoint is passed, if this setting is switched on.

----

Map settings
------------

Disable checkpoint circles
  The checkpoints on the route are shown as light grey circles and light green circles when a checkpoint is passed.
  Disabling this option has no effect on the indication of whether a checkpoint has been passed or not.
  If uploading is selected, the date and time of passing the checkpoint is still sent to the event organisation's server.

Track line width
  The line width (1 - 10) of the track.

Location color
  The colour of the current location and direction on the map. Click on the coloured circle to change its colour.
     
Live tracking color

Live tracking line width
