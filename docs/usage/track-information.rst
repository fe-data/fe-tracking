   The information screen gives an overview of all kinds of information such as emergency numbers,
   additional information about the event, order data and when checkpoints have been passed.
   The badge at the top right of the information icon is only green if all checkpoints have been passed. If not, it will be red.

"Help" screen
  By clicking on the information URL you can view additional information that the organisation provides.
  You can think of how to drive to the event, parking facilities, etc ...
  An emergency number is also visible that can be called in emergencies.
  Always read carefully beforehand the conditions under which the number can be called.

"Information" screen
  The information screen shows the order data, but also when the event is active, the so-called tracking-window.
  Only when the event is active, the route can be recorded and the ``Finish/exit`` qrcode can be shown to the organisation when requested.

"Checkpoints" screen
  This screen shows an overview when checkpoints have been passed and when this information has been uploaded to the event organisation's server.
  The upload is only shown and executed when the :guilabel:`Upload checkpoints` setting in the `Settings <../getting-started/settings.html#general-settings>`_ is enabled.

"Qrcode" screen
  This qrcode can be shown, for example, if the organisation does not use "automatic" checkpoints on the route, but instead performs the scans manually.
