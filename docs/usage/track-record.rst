      Pauze recording

If the current event is active, it means that the current date falls within the tracking window. See :doc:`Information <track-information>` screen.
Once this is the case, the recording icon will turn ``red`` instead of ``grey``.
Clicking on it will start recording the event; it will record the route travelled and check whether any checkpoints are passed.
The background of the event will become transparent red, so that in the overview it is clear which event is being recorded.

Whenever a checkpoint is passed, the counter next to the information icon will increase.
The counter remains ``red`` until all checkpoints are passed and then it turns ``green``.
At the same time, the "Finish/exit" qrcode will also turn ``green``.

.. note:: Only 1 event can be recorded at a time.

.. warning:: After recording is turned on, the phone's screen can simply be turned off. However, do not tuck the phone away deep into a bag as this may result in poor GPS reception.
   Preferably put the phone in a sport armband.
