   The *FE Tracking* App can be used as an addition to the `Fast Events WordPress plugin <https://docs.fast-events.eu/>`_.
   *FE Tracking* allows participants to view a route with points of interest and checkpoints along the way.
   The App records the date and time of passing the checkpoints and automatically uploads them to to the event organisation's server.

Typical use
-----------
Use the App to scan a printed ticket or a downloaded PDF ticket.
Turn recording on at the start of the route, turn off the screen and put it in a bracelet, for example.
Stop recording at the end of the track and show the finish/Exit qrcode to the organisation in order to receive,
for example, a medal or any other form of proof of participation.
