Getting started
---------------

The FE Tracking App can be used as an addition to the `Fast Events WordPress plugin <https://docs.fast-events.eu/>`_. The App offers participants - especially in sports events - the possibility
to show a route including points of interest and checkpoints along the route. The App registers the date and time of the passage of checkpoints and can,
if the participant chooses, automatically upload these to the server of the event organisation.
